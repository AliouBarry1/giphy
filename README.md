# Unit 6: Giphy Project

## Project Description
In this unit, you will create a Giphy App. The Giphy App will take a search term as an input and display a random Gif in a thumbnail on the screen. To create this project, you will learn the anatomy of an API Request, use Promises to make a simple GET request, handle a JSON response object, and use jQuery to display a gif.

## Day 1

## Day 1 Goal 1: Set Up

#### Planning

- [ ] Complete the project planning document.

#### GitHub Set-Up

- [x] Go to the repository
- [ ] Fork this repository to your Github account and import to a new workspace
- [ ] Submit your website using the link on the Agenda

#### Starter Code

- [ ] Read through the HTML starter code to understand the organization and class names given.
- [ ] Read through the `script.js` starter code to determine what global variables are declared, and what the two declared functions do.
- [ ] Go to the API documentation [here](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) to see how the API request is set up.

### JavaScript
- [ ] Create a working fetch() request inside the click handler.
- [ ] Declare a variable that stores the following API request URL: https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=puppy&rating=pg&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC
- [ ] Get the response from the API request.
- [ ] Log the response to the console.

### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!
- [ ] Save and submit your website link using the link on the session agenda.

## Day 2
### JavaScript
- [ ] Using the same API request URL from last class, display the image from your console.log to the webpage.
- [ ] Declare a variable and store the user's input inside of it.
- [ ] Use this variable to update the API request URL based on the user's input.
- [ ] Display the updated image on the screen.

### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3
### JavaScript
- [ ] Declare a variable that stores a random number from 0 to the total number of items (different GIFs) in the response
- [ ] Use this random variable to display a random GIF onto the screen

### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

### Project Extensions
- [ ] Display multiple images in the response to the screen.
